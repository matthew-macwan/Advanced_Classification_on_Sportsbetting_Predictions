# Advanced_Classification_Techniques_in_R

In this project, I attempt to see how accurately I can predict the Over/Under points for two NBA players, Damian Lillard and Robert Covington. Over/Under is a betting term used by sportsbooks where a person can place a bet on whether a player will get over or under X amount of points, assists, rebounds, etc. 

For an in-depth explanation of the project, analysis and takeaways along with the R code and outputs, please click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthew-macwan/Advanced_Classification_Techniques_in_R/main/Over_Under_Classification.html?token=AVKWQJ5DUQPSLF6RCON464TBY7GSY).
